# parcelvegserver

This is the server side for the parcel-vegetation code being delivered to BC Parks.

This exists primarily to facilitate the use of postGIS from the react application.

To use, you will have to instantiate and run it on the server prior to attempting to run parcel-vegetation.

This will presume communication on port 3001, which will also have to be specified on the client as 206.12.92.18:10190
